# Keto Nutrition Reference (shared)

General ketogenic framework, food data, fueling, and supplement timing for **every athlete**. Each person's daily macros, meals, and exact supplement doses live in `people/<id>/data.json` (`nutrition` section — rendered read-only by the dashboard).

Baseline: ketogenic — very low carbohydrate, high fat, adequate protein.

**Protein target:** ~1.8–2.4 g/kg/day. **Zinc:copper ratio** target ~10:1. Prefer water without chlorine.

## Supplement framework

Athletes take a similar stack; **doses are listed per person** in their `data.json` (scale dose-dependent items like creatine and electrolytes to bodyweight; keep micronutrients similar).

Core stack: D3 + K2 · Omega-3 (EPA/DHA) · creatine · low-sodium salt blend (NaCl + KCl, iodized) · magnesium glycinate stack (+ zinc, copper, B6) · citrulline malate · beta-alanine · caffeine · beef collagen + vitamin C (pre-training) · Brazil nuts (selenium).

**Timing:**
- **Pre-gym / pre-endurance:** caffeine + citrulline malate; creatine partial here or with a meal.
- **Pre-gym / pre-calisthenics (30–45 min before):** beef collagen + vitamin C.
- **With largest/evening meal:** magnesium glycinate + zinc + copper + B6; omega-3; D3 + K2; beta-alanine if not taken pre-workout.
- **Brazil nuts:** with any meal.

## Targeted keto (TKD) — fueling hard sessions

Use maltodextrin **only before/within genuinely hard endurance** (VO2max, threshold). Not for easy Z2, easy runs, long steady low-intensity sessions, or gym-only days by default.

| When | What | Amount | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Pre-gym (optional) | Maltodextrin | 15–20 g, 15–30 min before | Only if energy feels low |
| Pre-endurance (TKD) | Maltodextrin | 15–25 g, 15–30 min before | Standard for VO2max / threshold |
| Intra-gym | Maltodextrin | 15–20 g sipped | Only if session > ~50 min or energy drops |
| Intra-endurance (60–90 min hard) | Maltodextrin | 30–40 g/hr sipped | SGLT1 limit ~60 g/hr; no fructose needed |
| Race / competition | Maltodextrin : fructose 2:1 | 80–100 g/hr | Two transport pathways |
| Hard session > 90 min | Maltodextrin : fructose 2:1 | 60–80 g/hr | When exceeding ~90 min at effort |

**Rule:** add fructose (2:1 malto:fructose by carb weight) only when total carb delivery must exceed ~60 g/hr for > 90 min. Not needed for TKD-sized doses, easy work, or sessions under 60 min.

> Beginners should rarely need TKD — easy aerobic base work runs fine fat-adapted. Introduce small pre-session carbs only once doing genuinely hard intervals.

## Electrolytes

For long/hard sessions (> 90 min, or any session in heat):
- ~500–700 mg sodium/hr on top of baseline daily salt.
- Carry an electrolyte mix; avoid plain-water-only on long/hot efforts.

## Body composition — adjustment rules

- Weight drops unintentionally → increase calories (add fat first).
- Performance drops → check electrolytes, sleep, carbs around hard sessions, total calories.
- Fat gain occurs → reduce added fats first, **not** protein.
- High-volume training blocks → do not aggressively cut calories.
